use Python's built-in HTTP server to serve the contents of the public directory:

cd public
python3 -m http.server 8888

Open your browser and paste in the URL of your server, (http://localhost:8888 if you used port 8888 as suggested) into the address bar.

You should see your file rendered as a web page! While the server is running, open a new terminal window.
